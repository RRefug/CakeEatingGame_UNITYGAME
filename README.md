# My Story
I sought out a personal project after graduation that involved the game concept my younger sister envisioned. 
I had fun creating it using:
C# programming lanuage, 2D hand drawn sprite images by my little sister, scripts, collisions, gravity functionality, and UI funtionality using the Unity environment. 

Everything was learned using what I already knew and new research that I did while working a part time job.
I took it as a fun game project to keep my mind sharp and enjoy what coding could do with small games like this.

Research consister of youtube tutorials and even help on the internet when it came to learning new things about Unity and how it all worked.
